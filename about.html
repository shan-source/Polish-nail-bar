  My name is Shania Mitchell and I am 20 years old and I am from the
  beautiful country of Belize.I am currently in the Bachelors programm in business
  adminstration for entrepreneurship and I am enrolled at the University Of Belize.
  My dreams are learning to do nails too, and then having my own nail salon business one day.
 However, I sought to construct this service because it would help encourage me to meet new people
  and help the communtity to have a better service in the area.
